## O'Reilly Sandbox

If you are an O'Reilly member and would like to try things out on a temporary virtual machine, you can use this [devops-tools-sandbox](https://learning.oreilly.com/interactive-lab/devops-tools-sandbox/9781098126469).

To determine what version of Linux is being used you can run the command `cat /etc/os-release` at the terminal. This may be useful to know as you work through some of the examples. Note however that Docker is already installed in the VM.
